I grew a passion for coding in 2018 when I learned SAS and R programming during my grad school. I really loved the idea of functions and loops in programming. I was amazed to see how I could build a function and ran it every time I wanted without having to code it from scratch again. I loved programming so much that I attempted a certification exam in SAS programming and passed it! But these statistical tools require you to have a very solid understanding of statistics. But Statistics is something that always turns me off. I took few Statistics courses during my undergrad and grad school, but I never find it interesting. So, I wanted to see if I could build a career where I can use coding and my analytical skills to build cool stuffs. I found software engineering to be the exact field where I would love to work. I bought a python course on Udemy and also started practicing web development on freecodecamp. I was amazed to see how an html would instantly change and display the output as soon as I changed the code, even a bit of it! I could see what my program is going to be like while I was coding it! Can anything be more fun than that?  

However, while I was looking for different tools and resources to learn software engineering, I found that the internet was full of resources but none of them had a structured curriculum. Also, there was no way to ask for help if you were stuck on something. That was when I started to look for coding schools and luckily, I found Flatiron! I learned about Flatiron from a youtuber. She shared her journey how she transformed herself as a software developer within few months. Her story really inspired me. I also found few Flatiron grads on LinkedIn and talked to them to learn about their experiences at Flatiron. Moreover, Flatiron had the highest rating on course report. Everyone mentioned about the excellent career support and the project-based curriculum. Hence, I decided to start my journey to be a Software Engineer with Flatiron and I am super excited!!
